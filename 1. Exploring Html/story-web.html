        <h1>The Story In The Book</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>Smarty had been out of her window for about an hour. On her deck, lying between the copies of 
            <i>Nature, New Scientist, </i>and all other scientific journals her work had appeard in, was well
            thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly'sfavourite book since college, and the
            longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
        </p>
        <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that
            <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work,
             unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyrbonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding
             achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something to do.
