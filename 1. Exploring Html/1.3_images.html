    <h4>Three rules for creating IMAGES</h4>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Save images in the right format(either jpeg, gif or png)</li>
        <li>Save images at the right size
            <ul type="square">
                <li>Same width and height</li>
                <li>Must be smaller than the width and height</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Measure image height and width in pixels(not centimetres or inches)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
       <Strong>Advice: </Strong> <br />
        Whenever an image has different colors, you must use image format JPEG. Use GIF or PNG when
        saving an image with few colors or large areas of the same color (aka flat color).
