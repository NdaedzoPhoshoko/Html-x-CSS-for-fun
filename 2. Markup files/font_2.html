        <h3>What's scones?</h3>
        <p>
            Scones are a classic baked treat, often associated with British tea 
            traditions but enjoyed worldwide. They are slightly sweet, 
            biscuit-like pastries made from flour, butter, sugar, and milk 
            or cream, with baking powder as a leavening agent. Scones can be 
            served plain or studded with ingredients like raisins, currants, or 
            dried fruit, and are typically split open and topped with clotted cream, 
            butter, or jam. While traditionally round and slightly crumbly, they can 
            also be shaped into triangles or squares. Perfectly paired with tea or 
            coffee, scones are a versatile and comforting snack, enjoyed at breakfast, 
            tea time, or as a delightful addition to any gathering.
